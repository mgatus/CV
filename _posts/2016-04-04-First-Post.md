Beargrease is our fatbike designed to excel when speed matters—simple as that.

Fatbike doesn’t have to mean slow bike. It’s lightweight, agile, and elegant, with all excesses removed. Whether it is a 40-mile weekend race or the 1,000-mile Iditarod Invitational in Alaska, Beargrease is your best bet for getting from point A to point B fast, over whatever terrain stands between.
